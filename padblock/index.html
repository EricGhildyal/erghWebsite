			<h2> What is it? </h2>
			<p>Blockchain is a concept that gives us immense potential in building custom, completely secure applications by design.
			<br />You probably already know that, though. The better question is:</p>

			<h2> What are we doing with it? </h2>
			<p>We are leveraging blockchain's potential and our proprietary technology to make custom applications for security
			centric companies. We have the ability to modify the concept to fit your needs more closely.</p>

			<h2> Why do we have this ability? </h2>
			<p>We built our own blockchain! There's only one way to really know it's being done correctly while maintaining potential for modification:
				 build it yourself so you know exactly what's going on.</p>

			<h2> How are we qualified to make our own blockchain? </h2>
			<p>We're not, but then again, who is? What do you need to be "qualified" in blockchain? Extensive bitcoin knowledge, countless hours worth of research and planning,
			plenty of knowledge in data structures and distributed computing? In which case, maybe we are qualified!</p>

			<h2> What are we working on currently? </h2>
			<p>We are primarily focused on building a proof of concept application for a defense-based supply chain.</p>

			<h2> Who is "we"? </h2>
			<p>"We" are 3 students from the University Of Pittsburgh who love new technologies and solving problems:
